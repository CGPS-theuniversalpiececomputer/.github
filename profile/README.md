# Welcome to the universal piece computer, one name for our emerging computational global peace system.

This organization contains representations of the universal piece computer, maintained for the purpose of erecting, running, maintaining, and upgrading the system at large.

This project posits that **_by definition_** Humanity will maintain only ever maintain **one** global peace system, and that the only way such a system will persist (prosper in non trivial sense) is if the essence of the thing is _computational_, in a piecewise continuous evolutionary sense.
