# Welcome to THE UNIVERSAL PIECE COMPUTER (TUPC)

(TUPC being one name to our emerging COMPUTATIONAL GLOBAL PEACE SYSTEM.)

This Github organization contains one facet outfacing as the global representation of THE UNIVERSAL PIECE COMPUTER, PIECESPACE / PIECEBRAIN maintained for the purpose of erecting, running, maintaining, and upgrading the computational peace system at large, ie, hosting THE UNIVERSAL PIECE.

This project posits that **_by definition_** HUMANITY will only ever maintain **one** GLOBAL PEACE SYSTEM, and that the only way such a system will persist (prosper in a non trivial sense, without succumbing to GENERALIZED CORRUPTION) is if the essence of the thing is _computational_, in a PIECEWISE CONTINUOUS EVOLUTIONARY sense.
